## What is the project's vision? 

> This is typically a single sentence that describes what the project aspires to be. 
> Example: "A JS framework that allows developers to build better apps, faster". 
> If this doesn't exist, write "none".

A guide and application that:

- Teaches people how to solve common problems with DoneJS 
- Semonstrates that DoneJS elegantly solves common problems.

Produce people who can build a good guide without much
oversite.

## How will the project measure success? 

> Example: Increase mobile conversion rates to 0.75-1.0%, currently ~0.3%. If this doesn't exist, write "none".

- Approximately as many page views as PMO.
- If a question is directly related to parts of this guide, 
  we should be able to post a link to the relavant section and there are no follow ups except for 
  ones not covered by the guide.  Basically, if someone asks, how to deal with cookie based sessions, 
  we should post to this guide's `session` section.
- Github Stars?
- Roomplanner and Jobcostracker are successful without Justin managing them (but he's involved when appropriate).
