 		- able to get data for all of it pretty quick
 		- able to make selects that change options correctly.

 		- gets all players and stats, merges data
 		- when adding a stat, everything updates b/c of can-connect
 		
 - Node services and SSR on the same process.
 	- Why do this?
 		- mostly because if you are using node as a frontend server, you probably want it able to do other things besides can-serve
 	- How to do this.
 		- ssr
 		- live reload
 		- apis
 		- 404s
